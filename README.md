# HangMan
Simple Python Version of the game HangMan

(this was part of the Udemy course 100 days of python)

A random word is choosen and hidden from veiw
You are shown the number of letters the word contains, in the form of underscores
You are asked to quess on a letter that may be part of the hidden word
If you are wrong a head (circle) is added to the hangmans noose
If you are correct the letter is displayed
This continues until either the body legs and arms are added to the man
Or you guess the full word
the game ends
